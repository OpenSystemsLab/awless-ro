// Package awscredentials resolves the AWS credentials every command runs with.
//
// Resolution itself is the SDK's: environment, shared config and credentials files,
// SSO, assume-role chains, container and instance roles, in that order. Three things
// are added on top.
//
// Temporary credentials are cached on disk, because a CLI is a new process every
// time and an assume-role profile with MFA would otherwise ask for a token code on
// every command.
//
// Credentials are retrieved once during start-up rather than lazily on the first API
// call, so a missing or broken profile is reported before anything else happens
// instead of surfacing halfway through a sync.
//
// When there are none at all and someone is watching, the access keys are asked for
// and written to ~/.aws/credentials, which is the file every other AWS tool reads.
