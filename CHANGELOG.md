# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- `list --local` says when the service it reads was never synced in that region, also
  when another region of the profile was. A sync of us-west-2 left the global files
  behind, and `list instances --local -r eu-west-1` answered an empty list.
- With `--format json`, the "not synced" hint is a plain line on stderr, like the
  inspectors' notes, instead of an `[info]` log line.
- `inspect -i open_buckets` says that it reads bucket ACLs only, not bucket policies
  or Block Public Access, so an empty answer no longer reads as "no public buckets".

## v0.6.0

### Added

- `--format json` on every command but `ssh`: `show`, `whoami`, `inspect`, `config`,
  `switch`, `sync`, `version`, newline-delimited JSON from `tail`, and `{"id"}` from
  `search images --latest-id`. `--format` is now a global flag; `list --format` is
  unchanged. See [JSON output](README.md#json-output). (OpenSystemsLab/awless-ro#1)
- `list --ids --format json` prints an array of ids (per type for a service).

### Changed

- A command asked for a `--format` it cannot print (`whoami --format csv`) exits 1
  before doing anything. `list` keeps all five formats.
- Firewall rules, routes, grants and the other structured lists come out in a fixed
  order in every format, instead of a different one on each read of the local graph.
- The MFA code prompt, the first-run region prompt and `config set`'s value prompt
  are written to stderr.
- `make build` builds for arm64 unless `GOARCH` says otherwise; `release.go` and the
  README's install section list the arm64 archives first.
- CI and the release workflow also run the tests and the binary on arm64, natively,
  on GitHub's Linux arm64 and Apple Silicon runners.

### Fixed

- `sync` says which services could not be read, on stderr without `-v` and as
  `"error"` in JSON, and exits 1 when nothing could be synced, instead of reporting
  an account with nothing in it.
- `show` exits 1 with "not found" when the resource is gone after the refresh,
  instead of exiting 0 having printed nothing.
- `list <type> --format json` with no results prints `[]` instead of `null`.
- `list <service> --format json` lists each type's resources in id order.
- A property holding a float that is not a number no longer fails the whole JSON
  output; it is `null`.

## v0.5.0

**Breaking:** `switch` with `-p` or `-r` now exits 1 without saving anything. Pass the
profile and region as arguments instead: `awless-ro switch staging eu-west-1`. (#60)

### Added

- `list loggroups`: CloudWatch Logs log groups with class, retention, size and creation
  time. Synced with the rest of monitoring (`aws.monitoring.sync`). (#59, thanks @babyhuey)

### Fixed

- `switch` warns when `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` or the
  profile's own region overrides what it saved, and says how to make it apply.
  (#57, thanks @jay23606; #60)

## v0.4.0

### Added

- `ssh` works again: directly, through a jump host with `--through`, over the private
  IP with `--private`, offline with `--local`; `--print-cli` and `--print-config` print
  without connecting. (#47)
- `ssh -i` takes the key to use, as a file path or a key name. (#47)
- Without `-i`, `ssh` finds the private key by the key pair's name and then by its
  fingerprint, so the local file no longer has to be named like the key pair. (#49)
- `ssh` announces each guessed login user on stderr (`trying user ubuntu...`) and
  ends with a hint when none is accepted. (#49)

### Security

- `ssh` never offers the `ssh-rsa` (SHA-1) or DSA host-key algorithms. (#47)

## v0.3.0

**Re-run `sync` after upgrading:** Route 53 records get new ids in the local graph. (#41)

### Added

- `--filter key==value` matches the whole value; `key=value` still matches a substring. (#31)
- `--max-width N` on `list` and `show`; `0` means no limit. (#37)

### Changed

- Piped or redirected tables are no longer wrapped: one row per line. On a terminal,
  tables use its full width. (#37)
- `--format json` prints netmasks and route destinations as CIDR strings
  (`"10.0.0.0/16"`) instead of base64. (#35)
- An unreadable local graph file is an error (exit 1, naming the file) instead of an
  empty result. (#39)

### Fixed

- `--sort` on a boolean column, such as `list subnets --sort public`, no longer panics. (#33)
- `show` works for a name shared by two resource types, e.g. a keypair and a load
  balancer both named `prod`. (#41)
- Route 53 records with the same name and type (weighted, geolocation, or in different
  zones) are listed separately instead of merged. (#41)
- Wildcard DNS names show as `*.example.com` instead of `\052.example.com`. (#41)
- `--tag` matches IAM users and roles. (#41)
- A `--tag` value split at a comma is refused with a quoting hint instead of returning
  nothing. (#38)
- Graph files with very long lines, such as large IAM policies, load. (#39)

## v0.2.3

### Fixed

- Credentials exported in `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are used when
  `~/.aws` is absent (CI, containers); they were ignored since v0.1.0. (#32)
- A first run with `--aws-profile` takes the region from the profile instead of
  prompting for one. (#32)

## v0.2.2

### Fixed

- **`tail` is listed in `--help` and offered by completion.** It had been hidden since
  it first appeared upstream, as an experiment, though it works and the README
  documents it. Its help now says what it does, with examples.
- **`tail scaling-activities` with no activity said nothing and exited 0**, which reads
  the same as a silent failure. It now says there were no scaling activities in the
  last six weeks (as long as autoscaling keeps history), on stderr so stdout stays the
  events alone. (Inherited.)
- **`tail scaling-activities --follow` returned at once when there was no activity
  yet** — exactly when one wants to wait for the first. It now polls from that moment
  on. An invalid `--frequency` is refused before any AWS call. (Inherited.)

### Documentation

- The README opens with a recorded demo, and says plainly what the tool is for and how
  it gets its data: some commands ask the AWS API every time, `show` and `inspect` work
  on a synced graph, and `--local` answers from that copy without calling AWS.

## v0.2.1

### Fixed

- **`list buckets` could fail on its first run with "no such host"**, and succeed on
  the second ([#10](https://github.com/theazz/awless-ro/issues/10), inherited from
  upstream). To keep only the current region's buckets it called `GetBucketLocation`
  for every bucket in the account, all at once — each to the bucket's own hostname,
  so as many simultaneous DNS lookups of different names. A cold resolver, typically
  behind a VPN, answered some of them "no such host", the SDK does not retry that, and
  the first failure ended the whole listing. S3 now filters by region itself
  (`ListBuckets` with `BucketRegion`): one call instead of one per bucket, and
  `GetBucketLocation` is no longer among the operations the tool can perform (61 now).
  This applies to everything that reads buckets: `list buckets`, `list s3objects`,
  `show`, `sync` and the bucket inspectors.
- **Per-item API calls are bounded.** Fetchers that make one call per bucket, task
  definition revision, IAM user, load balancer, queue, hosted zone or ECS cluster
  started all of them at once, which in a large account meant hundreds or thousands of
  requests in the same instant and throttling the SDK's retry budget could not absorb.
  At most eight are now in flight per fetcher. When one fails the rest are stopped
  instead of being left blocked forever, and the access key fetcher no longer races on
  its error flag.

### Performance

- **A first `sync` takes about half as long** ([#12](https://github.com/theazz/awless-ro/issues/12)).
  IAM users, groups, roles and managed policies come from one
  `GetAccountAuthorizationDetails` pagination, and its pages were fetched one after
  another; IAM caps a page by size, so an account with ~500 roles and ~560 policies
  took 25 sequential pages and most of the sync. Each entity type is now its own
  pagination, run side by side. Measured from an empty home on the same account:
  `sync` 31–47s → 15.5s, `list policies` 19s → 11–13s. Same call, same permission,
  same result.

### Dependencies

- AWS SDK for Go v2 service modules updated (patch and minor releases).

## v0.2.0

### Features

- Shell completion for **fish** and **PowerShell**, alongside bash and zsh. The zsh
  script can now be installed as a completion file (it starts with `#compdef`), so
  package managers can set it up; the Homebrew formula will install all three.
- Completion is cobra's own rather than a hand-written generator, and what it offers
  is computed in Go, the same for every shell: resource ids and names for `show`,
  instances for `ssh` (keeping a `user@` prefix), stacks for `tail stack-events`,
  regions and profiles for `switch`, `-r` and `-p`, config keys with their help and
  their values for `config set`, inspectors for `inspect -i`, vendors for
  `search images`, formats for `list --format`.
- Completion answers from local state only. It never calls AWS, never syncs and,
  on a machine where awless-ro has not run yet, never starts first-run setup.
  Profile completion skips `sso-session` and `services` sections of `~/.aws/config`,
  which are not profiles.

## v0.1.1

### Fixed

- **The first command you ran synced the whole account before doing its own work.**
  `awless-ro whoami` needs a single `GetCallerIdentity`; on a machine with no
  `~/.awless-ro` it took about thirty-five seconds instead of two, because nine
  services and several thousand resources were fetched first. Writing the region for
  the first time went through the same path as changing it, and a region change
  schedules a sync — reasonably, since the local graph is per-region — but the first
  run is the initial write, not a change. Nothing needed the sync: commands fetch what
  they need when they are not given `--local`, and a local copy is what `sync` is for.
  Changing the region later still syncs, and `aws.autosync` still turns that off.
  ([#7](https://github.com/theazz/awless-ro/issues/7), inherited from upstream.)

  Measured on the same account, from an empty home: `whoami` 37s → 3s,
  `list instances` 30s → 1s, `list users` 36s → 1s,
  `search images canonical --latest-id` 41s → 1s.

- **`--local` said "No results found." when nothing had been synced yet**, which
  answers a question about the account in a situation where the account was never
  read. It now says so and names the setting to change. Reachable before, but rarely:
  the first run used to sync, so there was usually something there.

## v0.1.0 — first release of awless-ro

Fork of [wallix/awless](https://github.com/wallix/awless) at `44e892b4`, unmaintained
since 2018. The version number restarts: continuing upstream's `v0.1.11` would imply a
compatibility that does not exist.

Upstream's own changelog is kept below, unchanged, as the provenance of everything
this inherits.

Everything in this entry is a difference from `44e892b4`. Where a defect was inherited
rather than introduced here, it says so — the distinction matters, because an
inherited defect means the same bug is in the last released `awless` binary.

### Removed

The write half is gone. It was both the larger maintenance burden and the part least
safe to run unmaintained against a live account: six years of AWS API drift sits
between that code and reality, and its failure mode is not a wrong listing but a wrong
change.

- The templating language, the `.aws` template format, its lexer, parser, compiler and
  runner.
- Every `create`, `update`, `delete`, `attach`, `detach`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`,
  `check` and `copy` command, and the generated one-liner CLI behind them.
- `awless log` and `awless revert`, and the BoltDB tables backing them. The database
  remains for configuration.
- The scheduler integration, and with it the `github.com/wallix/awless-scheduler`
  dependency.
- `awless web` and the embedded HTTP server.
- `gopkg.in/src-d/go-git.v4`: the sync kept the local graph in a git repository and
  committed each sync. Nothing read the history.
- The `pricer` inspector. It sent an inventory of the account's EC2 instances to
  `ec2-price.com` over plain HTTP. That domain **was not registered** when this fork
  was made — `whois` returned no match — so anyone could have taken the name and
  started collecting. Removed rather than repointed.
- The `defaultsDefinitions` config store. Every entry in it — `instance.type`,
  `instance.count`, `securitygroup.protocol`, `volume.device` and the rest — supplied
  a default parameter to one of the removed commands, so nothing read them any more. A
  setting the user can change with no effect is worse than no setting. The store
  itself is kept, because older local databases may hold the legacy `region` and
  `sync.auto` keys.

`awless-ro switch` and `awless-ro config set` remain: they write to your
configuration, not to AWS.

Not yet working:

- **`awless-ro ssh`** is disabled. The resolution and connection logic is largely
  sound — against a live account it resolved an instance name to its private IP
  through the local graph and reached the host — but `--local` panics, `--print-cli`
  connects instead of printing, and the host key prompt loops when there is no
  terminal. The command explains this rather than running.

### Read-only is enforced, not intended

Every AWS call goes through a narrow per-service interface; nothing else in the tree
holds an SDK client. `TestEveryAWSOperationIsARead` reflects over those interfaces and
fails if any method name does not begin with `Describe`, `Get`, `List` or `Head`, or
if a field is a concrete client rather than an interface. Currently 62 operations
across 18 services. Reflecting over the struct rather than a hand-written list means a
service added later is covered without anyone remembering.

This constrains the tool, not your credentials. An administrative profile is still an
administrative profile.

### Platform

- Go modules instead of `dep`; no `vendor/` directory. Module path
  `github.com/theazz/awless-ro`.
- Go 1.26.
- **AWS SDK v2**, from v1.10.27 (2017). The migration is behind a test written first:
  SDK v2 changes the value semantics the reflective property extraction assumes —
  scalars stop being pointers, list elements stop being pointers, enums become named
  string types — and none of that is a compile error. Without it the binary would have
  built, run, and listed resources with silently empty columns.
- `go.etcd.io/bbolt` instead of the archived `github.com/boltdb/bolt`.
- `golang.org/x/crypto` at v0.57.0, from a 2018 revision carrying three CVEs
  reachable from this code: CVE-2020-9283, CVE-2021-43565 and CVE-2022-27191, all in
  the SSH client path.
- `github.com/wallix/triplestore` replaced by an in-tree `triplestore/` package. The
  dependency was unmaintained and most of it was unused; a quarter of it covered what
  this tool needs. The replacement is 1246 lines at 86% coverage, and writing it
  surfaced six defects in the original, listed below.
- Binary, module and state directory renamed to `awless-ro` / `~/.awless-ro`.
  Sharing `~/.awless` with an installed upstream `awless` would mean sharing its
  graph, database and key directory.

### Defects fixed

**Wrong answers about your account.** All nine of these were found by running against
a live account; none was visible to a unit test, because each turns on something a
test cannot know about AWS: what the vendors actually name their images, what an
account actually contains, what AWS itself considers the right answer.

- `search images <vendor> --latest-id` returned a **specialised build instead of the
  ordinary image** for three of the six vendors: `al2023-ami-minimal-`,
  `debian-13-backports-`, `suse-…-sp6-chost-byos-`. Vendors publish these alongside
  the ordinary image, under a name sharing its prefix and sometimes seconds newer, and
  the newest match won. The SUSE case is the damaging one: `byos` means bring your own
  subscription, so that instance comes up unregistered, and `chost` is a container host
  rather than a general-purpose server — none of it visible in the printed id. The EC2
  name filter cannot express the difference, because its only wildcard matches hyphens
  too, so each vendor now also declares an anchored expression applied after the
  fetch. (Inherited: upstream's patterns had the same shape.)
- **Image ordering turned on a one-second publication gap.** Amazon Linux publishes
  kernel 6.1, 6.12 and 6.18 builds of one release within seconds, and the 6.1 build
  happened to land last, so it was reported as the latest while AWS's own
  `al2023-ami-kernel-default` pointer named 6.18. Images of one release are now ranked
  among themselves by name, and a release is dated by its newest image.
- **Every failure exited 0.** `main` discarded the error from the root command. For
  output built to be read by a program — `id=$(awless-ro search images canonical
  --latest-id)` — a failed lookup was indistinguishable from success with an empty id.
  (Inherited.)
- **The flag list printed over the error message.** cobra prints usage whenever a
  command returns an error, which is right for a mistyped flag and wrong for "no image
  matched": the message a person needs scrolled off the top. Usage is now silenced
  once the command line has parsed. (Inherited.)
- **`show <sns-topic>` exited 1 with an internal message.** SNS subscriptions were
  keyed by their endpoint, and for the `lambda` and `sqs` protocols an endpoint *is*
  another resource's ARN — so the subscription and the function became one graph node
  carrying two `rdf:type` triples, and everything holding only an id failed.
  `list subscriptions` kept working because it resolves by type first, which is how
  this survived to a live account. The same key also merged distinct subscriptions:
  one queue subscribed to two topics is two subscriptions and was one node.
  (Inherited.)
- **A disabled resource type was reported as `0`.** `-> dns: 2 zones, 0 record`
  against an account holding 84 records. Two types are off by default because they
  cost an API call per parent; zero is an answer about the account, and nothing had
  been looked at. Now `records: off (aws.dns.record.sync)`. The help text for those
  keys also said `(when empty: true)` while sitting beside the value `false`.
  (Inherited.)
- **`list infra --format porcelain` panicked.** Columns are chosen per resource type,
  a whole-service listing has no single type, so rows were built zero cells wide while
  the sorter ordered by column 0. (Inherited.)
- **`--columns id` produced a blank column** for whole-service listings. A name
  matching no declared column is read as a property name — the only way to reach
  properties no listing declares a column for, such as an instance's `Architecture` —
  and the name was guessed with `strings.Title`, so `id` became `Id` while the
  property is `ID`. Names now resolve through the generated property registry.
  (Inherited.)
- **A relation pointing outside the local graph stopped the traversal.** A node named
  by a relation but never fetched has no type, which is ordinary: relations cross
  services, and a service may be off, refused for want of permissions, or not synced.
  One security group applying to something unsynced was enough to end
  `inspect -i port_scanner` with "resource type not found" and no output at all. The
  direct listing methods already answered with `NotFoundResource`, so the same graph
  was fine through one door and fatal through another. (Inherited.)

**Data integrity.**

- **Composite ids merged distinct resources.** The id for a Route53 record or a
  CloudWatch metric is a hash of its fields, and the fields were concatenated without
  a separator and hashed with adler32. `("AWS/EC2", "CPUUtilization")` and
  `("AWS/EC2C", "PUUtilization")` produced the same id. Now NUL-separated and hashed
  with truncated SHA-256. (Inherited.)
- Six defects in the triple store, found while replacing it: N-Triples escaping
  handled only `\n` and `\r`, so a literal backslash-n in a value was written as a
  real newline and read back changed, and a language tag could truncate the value;
  the object of a triple was parsed from the left, which mis-split values containing
  the delimiter; `clone()` dropped a blank node's sub-node flag; `Resource()`
  reported blank nodes as resources; `Equal()` did not distinguish blank nodes;
  `TraverseDFS` swallowed the error from its visitor. The on-disk format was pinned by
  a golden-file test before the replacement, and both the pre-existing and current
  files are checked against it. (Inherited.)
- `inspect -i bucket_sizer` read properties with unchecked type assertions, so an
  object carrying no `Bucket`, or a `Size` that did not arrive as an `int`, took the
  process down. Its output was also ordered by map iteration, so the same data printed
  differently on every run. (Inherited.)

**Security.**

- The SSH `ProxyCommand` path wrote an executable shell script into the shared `/tmp`
  on every connection, at a predictable path, and then ran it — a symlink and a race
  away from executing someone else's code, and the script interpolated a hostname into
  a shell command line. Removed; the workaround it implemented was for an OpenSSH CVE
  fixed in 2016. Verified against `ssh -G` and `sh -c` that quoting now behaves.
- `awless-ro whoami`'s public-IP lookup went to an HTTP endpoint; now HTTPS.
- Private key handling: `x509.DecryptPEMBlock`, deprecated and not
  authenticated, replaced with `ssh.ParsePrivateKeyWithPassphrase`. Key files with
  permissions other than 0600 are refused rather than used. A keypair name containing
  `..` can no longer escape the keys directory.
- Directory creation errors were discarded, turning a permissions problem into a
  confusing failure to open a file in a directory that was never created. Modes are
  now explicit: 0700 for directories holding keys or an account's synced picture, 0600
  for the files.
- `show` on an instance no longer prints its `UserData`. Bootstrap scripts routinely
  carry tokens, and it was displayed in full, in a table, by default.

**Correctness of the credentials path.** (The prompt and cache are new here; upstream
resolved credentials differently.)

- The first run did not reach credential resolution at all when `~/.aws` was absent —
  exactly the case the prompt exists for — because a profile not being defined was
  treated as an error.
- The prompt echoed the secret access key as it was typed.
- With no terminal it looped forever instead of failing with a message.
- An existing profile section was appended to rather than left alone, producing a
  duplicate section that breaks the file for every reader.
- `errors.As` against `*SharedConfigProfileNotExistError` never matched, because the
  SDK declares `Error()` on the value and returns a value. The first version of the
  fix above looked right and silently did nothing.

### Behaviour changes worth knowing

- `--ids` prints ids only. It used to print each resource's name as well, on its own
  line between the ids, which a script cannot tell apart from an id. Shell completion,
  which wants both, now asks for both explicitly.
- `--columns` is honoured for whole-service listings, where it was accepted and
  ignored.
- `search images` is no longer a hidden command, and its deprecated `--id-only` flag
  is gone in favour of `--latest-id`.
- AMI search pins the publishing account with the `Owners` request parameter rather
  than an `owner-id` filter, and refuses a search that names no account
  (`ErrNoOwner`) before sending a request. Both are controls against the
  [whoAMI name confusion attack](https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/whoami-a-cloud-image-name-confusion-attack/),
  disclosed in 2025, which turned exactly this into code execution for tooling that
  fed the result to `run-instances`. This tool launches nothing, but it prints an id
  that a person will paste somewhere.
- AMI matching happens on the AWS side. Upstream fetched every public image an owner
  had ever published and filtered in Go with `strings.HasPrefix`; Canonical alone has
  tens of thousands.
- AMI vendors `coreos` and `centos` removed. CoreOS Container Linux reached end of
  life in 2020. CentOS Linux 7 did so in June 2024, and the account publishing CentOS
  Stream images could not be confirmed from a source belonging to the project or to
  AWS — the Marketplace listings under that name are third-party rebuilds. Shipping an
  unverified account id is the whoAMI mistake. Both are named in the error, with the
  `--owner`/`--name` escape hatch.
- `search images` accepts `arm64`. Upstream accepted only `i386` and `x86_64`;
  Graviton did not exist when that list was written.
- Vendor account ids and name patterns were re-verified, and two had drifted: Debian
  now publishes from `136693071363`, not `379101102735`, and Canonical's image names
  gained a storage-class segment (`hvm-ssd` became `hvm-ssd-gp3`).
- Region defaults, sync toggles and profile handling are unchanged, but settings that
  only affected removed commands are gone from `config list`.

### Supply chain and tooling

- CI pins every action to a commit SHA, declares least-privilege `permissions`, runs
  `go mod verify` and `govulncheck`, and gates on generated files being current. Each
  gate was checked by mutation — a deliberately broken tree must fail it.
- Releases publish `SHA256SUMS`, in a format `sha256sum -c` and `shasum -a 256 -c`
  both accept. Release artefacts are built for darwin and linux on amd64 and arm64,
  and windows on amd64; 386 was dropped.
- The release tool used to exit 0 having produced a partial release when a build
  failed, and replaced the environment wholesale so the module cache could not be
  found.
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) records the supply-chain rules for adding a
  dependency.
- Code generation is idempotent and verified as such in CI.

### Tests

`go test ./... -race` is green and no test requires AWS credentials, which is checked
by running with an empty `HOME` and no `AWS_*` variables.

Coverage where it matters: `aws/image` 98%, `cloud/match` 96%, `sync` 92%,
`triplestore` 86%, `aws/credentials` 80%, `aws/conv` 80%. The `commands` package had
no tests at all and now has some.

Every fix above is pinned by a test that was checked by mutation: restoring the old
behaviour must fail it. Several of these fixes exist *because* writing the test
surfaced the defect — the composite id collision and the N-Triples escaping both came
out that way.

## v0.1.10 [2018-04-13]

### Features

- Much better performance when synchronising all access data (IAM, etc.)
- Create instances now supports distro prompting for CentOS, Amazon Linux 2, CoreOS
   
      $ awless create instance name=myinst distro=amazonlinux:amzn2
      $ awless create instance distro=coreos
      $ awless create instance distro=centos name=myinst

- Avoiding extra throttling: Listing flag `--filter` now passes on the user wanted filtering down to the AWS API when possible so that _less unneeded resources are fetched_, _bandwidth is reduced_ and _some throttling avoided_.
  
  For example:
  
      $ awless ls s3objects --filter bucket=website
      $ awless ls records --filter name=io
      $ awless ls containertasks --filter name=my-task-definition-name

- Support for region embedded in an AWS profile (i.e. shared config files ~/.aws/{credentials,config}). See #181 in Fixes for more details 
      
- [#191](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/191) Attach a certificate to a listener with: `awless listener attach id=... certificate=...` (see awless attach listener -h for more)

## v0.1.9 [2018-01-16]

**In this release, the local data model has been updated to support multi-account and stale data is removed when upgrading. Local data (ex: used for completion, etc...) will progressively be synced again through your usage of awless. Although, to get all your data now under the new model, you can manually run `'awless sync'`**	

### Features

- Support and seamless sync across multi-account (i.e. multiple profiles) and regions
- Enriched params prompting with optional/skippable but very common params. Can be disabled with `--prompt-only-required` or forced with `--prompt-all` to leverage smart completion for all params
- Automatically complete the username when deleting an access key by its ID, if it is contained in the local graph model:
    * `awless delete accesskey id=ACCESSKEYID`
-  For `awless update stack` param `stackfile` can now slurp yml and json params files. Thanks to @Trane9991 ([#167](https://github.com/wallix/awless/pull/167), [#145](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/145))
- Better completion for template parameters independently of their display name
- Aliases can now be resolved to properties other than IDs. For example, they are resolved to ARN in attach/detach/update/delete policy: `awless attach policy arn=@my-policy-name`
- Running only `awless switch` now returns your current region and profile, allowing a quick and short region/profile lookup
- Better completion of slice properties 

### AWS Services

- Listing of Route53 records now contains a new column for aliases [#181](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/181)
- Create an image from an existing instance. See `awless create image -h`

    * `awless start database id=my-db-id`
    * `awless stop database id=@my-db-name`
    * `awless restart database id=@my-db-name`
- Restart an EC2 instance
  * `awless restart instance id=id-1234`
