// POSTing the account's instance types and region to ec2-price.com over plaintext
// HTTP, and by 2026 that domain was no longer registered — anyone could have
// claimed it, harvested the inventory and dictated the numbers we printed as
// fact. It is removed rather than repaired. Pricing belongs to the AWS Pricing
// API, as its own feature, if it is wanted at all.
